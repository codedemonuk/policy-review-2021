## Community Safety

+++

### Safer Streets

Note:

Home Office Safer Streets Fund – following a successful bid Hertsmere BC were awarded £124,000 to address neighbourhood crime within the Cowley Hill Ward.  The funding was awarded in April and must be spent by the end of March 2022.  Over the coming months the CCTV in the area will be upgraded; installation of new communal, access-controlled, doors to the entrances of the flats above shops and refurbishment of the planters in Leeming Road; environmental enhancements to the rear of the shops in Leeming road is planned too.  On 30 October there will be a Halloween themed event at Leeming Park, Belford Road - see flyer on the next slide.

CCTV

Note:

CCTV – via the Safer Streets fund we have managed to secure some additional mobile cameras – these will be rolled out to ‘hot spot’ ASB areas. In addition we are looking to upgrade the cameras along Shenley Road using S106 monies

+++

### Recruitment

Note:

The full time post of Partnerships Support Officer is currently vacant – we have had one failed attempt to recruit to this post – this will be re-advertised in the near future. This will allow us to refresh/improve our Communications Strategy, re-start our own Safer Streets initiative, enhance our community engagement, alongside taking over the administrative function of the CSP

+++

### Community Trigger

Note:

Community Trigger process – we have been working with ASB Help  (http://www.asbhelp.co.uk) to ensure we have the correct processes and procedures in place.  We are nearly there but are awaiting the review of the PCC’s to establish what they will bring to the Community Trigger table.

+++

### CSP Action Plan

Note:

CSP Action Plan – this is ongoing and will continue to be so for the rest of the year.  In the New Year work will commence on our Plan for the forthcoming year.

+++

### Schools

Note:

Continued liaison with schools – we will be meeting with them to establish what their needs are and will arrange any training/awareness events, as required

+++

### Partnerships

Note:

We will continue to work on improving our Partnership by engaging with more partners on a regular basis i.e. CGL our drug an alcohol service provider, health etc

+++

### Daily meetings with Police

Note:

Throughout the pandemic a member of my team has attended the morning meeting with police colleagues (known as DTM – Daily Tasking Meeting) this has proved to be invaluable and will continue as part of our normal work stream
