### Safer Streets

Note:

Home Office Safer Streets Fund – following a successful bid Hertsmere BC were awarded £124,000 to address neighbourhood crime within the Cowley Hill Ward.  The funding was awarded in April and must be spent by the end of March 2022.  Over the coming months the CCTV in the area will be upgraded; installation of new communal, access-controlled, doors to the entrances of the flats above shops and refurbishment of the planters in Leeming Road; environmental enhancements to the rear of the shops in Leeming road is planned too.  On 30 October there will be a Halloween themed event at Leeming Park, Belford Road - see flyer on the next slide.

### CCTV

Note:

CCTV – via the Safer Streets fund we have managed to secure some additional mobile cameras – these will be rolled out to ‘hot spot’ ASB areas.
In addition we are looking to upgrade the cameras along Shenley Road using S106 monies.

### Partnership Support Officer

Note:

The full time post of Partnerships Support Officer is currently vacant – we have had one failed attempt to recruit to this post – this will be re-advertised in the near future. This will allow us to refresh/improve our Communications Strategy, re-start our own Safer Streets initiative, enhance our community engagement, alongside taking over the administrative function of the CSP

### Community Trigger

Note:

For those of you unfamiliar with it, the Community Trigger allows people who have reported an incident 3 or more times within a 6 month period to activate the Community Trigger (also known as an ASB Case Review) through the Council.
This has been designed to give victims, the right to demand that agencies deal with persistent anti-social behaviour.

There will be a multi-agency case review which involves various agencies (eg. local Police, Local Authority, Housing Association, NHS, etc.).
This is different from a single-agency complaints process which looks at faults in the way an agency responded.
The Community Trigger process is more of an attempt to ultimately fix the problem and stop the anti-social behaviour.

We have been working with ASB Help  (http://www.asbhelp.co.uk) to ensure we have the correct processes and procedures in place.
We are nearly there but are awaiting the review with the PCC to establish what they will bring to the Community Trigger table.

Note:

Continued liaison with schools – we will be meeting with them to establish what their needs are and will arrange any training/awareness events, as required

### Police

Note:

Throughout the pandemic a member of the community safety team has attended the morning meeting with police colleagues (known as DTM – Daily Tasking Meeting) this has proved to be invaluable and will continue as part of our normal work stream

## Performance

Note:

The Executive is currently working on the Corporate Plan which will be complete in the next few months and come through Executive and Full Council for adoption.
As part of that plan there will be a number of commitments that we will be making to the community.

An action plan will be developed based on those commitments and the Performance Panel will work with officers to come up with an effective way of monitoring and reporting on performance against those commitments.

### Future Work Design

Note:

The Future Work Design project is looking at redesigning the way office space is used by the council officers into a full hybrid working model.
It hopes to build upon lessons learnt about remote and flexible working during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns.
We will be looking at work stations, meeting spaces and touch down areas that may be required in the future to support new ways of working, and redesigning and re-purposing the work space.

### Business Systems

Note:

We are on track to make progress on moving our 5 major businesses systems off premise and to hosted/cloud hosted platforms.

Civica Icon payments and bank reconciliation system now fully hosted. Remaining modules distribution and bank reconciliation migrated to hosted platform August 2021. On premise servers being decommissioned September 2021.

Finance System will be migrated over the year to Advance Systems Cloud Financials hosted on suppliers AWS platform.
The project target date is to migrate finance system Q1 2022/23 (April/May 2022).

Mitel Telephony system, procurement for support and to migrate on premise infrastructure to a hosted/cloud hosted platform due to be advertised.
Although until we have evaluated supplier responses it is not possible to set a target date to migrate to hosted/cloud hosted platform it is reasonable that this can be achieved Q4 2021/22 to Q1 2022/23.

Idox Uniform system is used by Planning, Environmental Health, Land Charges, Housing, and Asset Management.
We have a proposal from Idox to migrate the Uniform system to MS Azure.
IDS Business Team are organising meetings with other LA Uniform users who have migrated to MS Azure.
The proposal has been shared with  Head of Planning (Ross Whear) and IDS will meet with Planning in September to discuss.
IDS will also engage with other stakeholders in Enrivonmental Health, Legal, Housing and Asset Management.
The proposal is to build a full ‘test’ system in MS Azure, this will allow the various departments to fully test the modules they use.
This will require resourcing and further discussion will be required with the relevant Service Heads.
Once all modules tested and signed-off by Service Heads ‘live’ system will be migrated to MS Azure.
This front loads the project, once testing is completed and signed–off it will be relatively straight forward to move the ‘live’ system. Key will be in the testing.
Uniform is a large system used by 5 service departments and resourcing testing will be key, all services must sign-off before migrating ‘live’ system.
A realistic estimated target date would be Q3/Q4 2022/23.

Civica Open Revenues,  Council Tax, Housing Benefits, NNDR.
IDS have met with Civica Account Manager and expressed the Authority’s strategy to move to a hosted/cloud hosted platform.
Civica are developing a ‘Civica cloud’ Revenues and Benefits solution.
This is still at an early stage, they will not be able to demonstrate anything until April 2022.
Civica model will be a fully managed service and they said there would not be an option for them to host and our staff to manage the releases etc..
IDS suspect this solution will come at a cost and it maybe that HBC explore the market for other R&B solutions.
Either way this will be a large project, Civica still developing a cloud solution or a full procurement.
With current resources it would not be feasible to achieve hosted/cloud hosted in 2022.

### Infrastructure

Note:

VMWare Horizon being implemented to replace out of support Citrix environment, October 2021.
This will be used by Idox Uniform and Civica Open Revenues users who have experienced performance issues over the VPN.
Initially this will be an on premise installation but will be migrated to the cloud when Uniform and Open revenues are moved to a cloud platform.
It will also be used to control supplier support access.

Veeam cloud backup and restore is being introduced with data being backed up to both Azure and AWS.
This will replace our existing Acronis backup system.

Additional BT internet connection added to provide resilience and performance.

Infrastructure servers  are being moved from on premise to Azure, this is an ongoing project, target date for completion Q1 2022/23. Azure is first option for any new server requests.

eBase eforms, external and internal eforms. All forms to be migrated or rewritten on Netcall platform (new cloud hosted CRM system). Target date December.

Sharepoint and OneDrive personal and departmental data drives, implement SharePoint and OneDrive. Target date Q3 2022/23.

Infrastructure Team will also look at ways of exploiting MS 365 functionality.
